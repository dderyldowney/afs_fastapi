Feat: Integrate CrdtClient into FarmTractor for field allocation

This commit updates the `FarmTractor` class to interact with the `FieldAllocationCRDT` via new FastAPI endpoints, enabling distributed field allocation management.

Key changes include:
- Added `httpx` as a project dependency for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
- Created `afs_fastapi/services/crdt_client.py` to encapsulate HTTP client logic for CRDT endpoints.
- Modified `afs_fastapi/equipment/tractor.py` to:
    - Import `CrdtClient` and `FieldSegment`.
    - Initialize `CrdtClient` in the `FarmTractor` constructor.
    - Add asynchronous methods (`assign_field_segment`, `release_field_segment`, `complete_field_segment`, `get_allocated_field_segments`, `get_unallocated_field_segments`, `get_completed_field_segments`) that utilize the `CrdtClient` to interact with the CRDT FastAPI endpoints.

This completes the third chunk of the Enhanced Synchronization phase, making the `FarmTractor` capable of participating in distributed field allocation.
