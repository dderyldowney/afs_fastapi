Feat: Expose FieldAllocationCRDT via FastAPI endpoints

This commit integrates the `FieldAllocationCRDT` into the FastAPI application by exposing its functionality through a set of new API endpoints.

Key changes include:
- Imported `FieldAllocationCRDT` and `FieldSegment` into `afs_fastapi/afs_fastapi/api/main.py`.
- Initialized a global instance of `FieldAllocationCRDT`.
- Added new API endpoints under `/crdt/` for:
    - Adding new field segments (`POST /crdt/segments`)
    - Assigning segments to tractors (`POST /crdt/assign`)
    - Releasing segments from tractors (`POST /crdt/release`)
    - Marking segments as completed (`POST /crdt/complete`)
    - Retrieving allocated, unallocated, and completed segments (`GET /crdt/segments/allocated/{tractor_id}`, `GET /crdt/segments/unallocated`, `GET /crdt/segments/completed`)
    - Merging CRDT states from other replicas (`POST /crdt/merge`)

This completes the second chunk of the Enhanced Synchronization phase, making the CRDT accessible and usable within the FastAPI application.
