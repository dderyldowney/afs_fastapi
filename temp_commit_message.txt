Feat: Implement FieldAllocationCRDT for enhanced synchronization

This commit introduces the core Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) for managing field segment allocations, a key component for enhanced synchronization in multi-tractor operations.

Key changes include:
- Created `afs_fastapi/models/field_segment.py` to define the `FieldSegment` Pydantic model, representing a unit of a field with status, assignment, and a timestamp for conflict resolution.
- Implemented `afs_fastapi/services/crdt_manager.py` with the `FieldAllocationCRDT` class. This operation-based CRDT provides methods for adding, assigning, releasing, and completing field segments, as well as merging CRDT states using a last-write-wins strategy.

This completes the first chunk of the Enhanced Synchronization phase, laying the foundation for robust distributed field allocation.
