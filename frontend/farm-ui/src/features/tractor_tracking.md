# Conceptual Implementation: Real-time Tractor Tracking and Status Display

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a conceptual approach for implementing real-time tractor tracking and status display within the React-based farm management application. The goal is to provide users with up-to-date information on the location, operational status, and key metrics of their agricultural machinery.

## 2. Data Source and Communication

Real-time tractor data will be sourced from the AFS FastAPI backend, which aggregates data from edge devices on the tractors. The communication mechanism will prioritize low-latency and efficient updates.

*   **Primary Mechanism: WebSockets:** For true real-time updates, WebSockets will be the preferred communication protocol. The backend will push updates to connected frontend clients as soon as new tractor data is available.
    *   **Backend:** FastAPI will expose a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/tractor-updates`).
    *   **Frontend:** React components will establish a WebSocket connection and listen for incoming messages.
*   **Fallback/Initial Load: REST API Polling:** For initial data load or in scenarios where WebSockets are not feasible, a REST API endpoint (`/api/tractors/status`) can be polled at regular intervals.

## 3. Frontend Components (Conceptual React Structure)

We will develop several React components to display tractor tracking and status information.

### a. `TractorMap` Component
*   **Purpose:** Display tractors on an interactive map, showing their current location, heading, and operational status.
*   **Dependencies:** A mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS, Google Maps API).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Render tractor icons at their GPS coordinates.
    *   Update tractor positions and orientations in real-time.
    *   Display tooltips or popups with basic status information on hover/click.
    *   Color-code tractors based on status (e.g., green for operating, yellow for idle, red for error).

### b. `TractorStatusList` Component
*   **Purpose:** Provide a tabular or card-based list of all tractors with their detailed status and key metrics.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Display `device_id`, `status` (Operating, Idle, Error), `current_task`, `speed`, `fuel_level`, `engine_temp`, etc.
    *   Allow sorting and filtering of tractors.
    *   Clickable rows/cards to navigate to a detailed `TractorDetails` view.

### c. `TractorDetails` Component
*   **Purpose:** Display comprehensive information for a single selected tractor.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Detailed operational metrics (e.g., historical data, sensor readings).
    *   Live camera feed (if available).
    *   Control options (start/stop, pause/resume task, adjust settings - conceptual).
    *   Maintenance logs and alerts.

## 4. Real-time Updates and State Management

*   **State Management:** We will use React's Context API or a state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to manage the global state of tractor data.
*   **WebSocket Integration:**
    *   A dedicated service or custom hook will manage the WebSocket connection.
    *   Incoming WebSocket messages will dispatch actions to update the global tractor state.
*   **Component Re-rendering:** React components subscribed to the tractor state will automatically re-render when data changes, ensuring real-time display.

## 5. Data Structure (Conceptual)

Data received from the backend for each tractor will follow a standardized format:

```json
{
  "tractor_id": "TRAC-001",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-07T10:30:00Z",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 34.0522,
    "longitude": -118.2437,
    "heading": 90.5
  },
  "status": "Operating",
  "current_task": "Planting Field A",
  "speed_kmh": 8.2,
  "fuel_level_percent": 75,
  "engine_temp_celsius": 85.1,
  "alerts": [
    "Low Fuel"
  ]
}
```

## 6. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication/Authorization:** Ensure only authorized users can view and control tractor data.
*   **Data Encryption:** All communication (WebSocket, REST) will be encrypted (TLS/SSL).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints and WebSocket connections to prevent abuse.
