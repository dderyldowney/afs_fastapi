# Conceptual Implementation: Field Management Tools

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a conceptual approach for developing field management tools within the React-based farm management application. These tools will enable users to define and visualize farm field boundaries, assign tasks to agricultural equipment, and monitor field-specific operations.

## 2. Key Features

### a. Field Boundary Drawing
*   **Purpose:** Allow users to accurately define and edit the geographical boundaries of their farm fields.
*   **Interaction:** Users will interact with an interactive map (e.g., using Leaflet Draw or Mapbox GL Draw) to draw polygons representing field boundaries. Tools for editing, deleting, and merging boundaries will be provided.
*   **Data Storage:** Field boundary data (GeoJSON or similar format) will be stored in the backend and associated with the farm.

### b. Task Assignment
*   **Purpose:** Enable users to assign specific agricultural tasks (e.g., planting, spraying, harvesting, irrigation) to individual fields or sections of fields.
*   **Interaction:** Users will select a field on the map or from a list, choose a task type, specify parameters (e.g., crop type, application rate, start/end dates), and assign it to available equipment.
*   **Task Status:** Visual indicators on the map and in task lists will show the status of assigned tasks (e.g., pending, in progress, completed, paused).

### c. Field Visualization
*   **Purpose:** Display various layers of information related to fields, such as crop health, soil data, yield maps, and historical data.
*   **Interaction:** Users will be able to toggle different data layers on the map to gain insights into field conditions and performance.

## 3. Frontend Components (Conceptual React Structure)

### a. `FieldMap` Component
*   **Purpose:** An interactive map component that displays farm fields, allows boundary drawing, and visualizes task assignments.
*   **Dependencies:** Mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS) with drawing plugins.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Load and display existing field boundaries.
    *   Provide tools for drawing, editing, and deleting polygons.
    *   Overlay task assignments and their status.
    *   Display sensor data overlays (e.g., soil moisture heatmaps).

### b. `FieldList` Component
*   **Purpose:** A list or table view of all defined farm fields, with summary information and quick actions.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Display field name, area, current crop, and overall status.
    *   Allow filtering and sorting.
    *   Clickable items to view `FieldDetails`.

### c. `TaskAssignmentForm` Component
*   **Purpose:** A form for creating and assigning new tasks to fields or equipment.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Select task type, field, equipment, and parameters.
    *   Date and time pickers for scheduling.
    *   Validation of input parameters.

### d. `FieldDetails` Component
*   **Purpose:** Display comprehensive information about a selected field.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Summary of field characteristics (area, soil type).
    *   List of current and historical tasks.
    *   Graphs/charts of historical sensor data and yield.
    *   Options to edit field properties or assign new tasks.

## 4. Data Flow and Synchronization

*   **Backend API:** The AFS FastAPI backend will expose REST API endpoints for managing field data (create, read, update, delete boundaries, tasks).
*   **Frontend-Backend Communication:** React components will interact with these API endpoints to fetch and update field data.
*   **Real-time Updates (Future Consideration):** For real-time updates on task progress or field changes, WebSockets could be integrated (similar to tractor tracking).

## 5. Security Considerations

*   **Access Control:** Ensure only authorized users can create, modify, or view field data and assign tasks.
*   **Data Validation:** Implement robust validation for all incoming field and task data to prevent errors and maintain data integrity.
*   **Audit Trails:** Log all significant changes to field boundaries and task assignments for accountability.
