## Active Issues

### 1. Token Usage API Tests Fail in Parallel Execution (2 tests)

**Status:** ACTIVE - 2/860 tests failing (99.8% pass rate)

**Affected Tests:**
- `tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py::TestTokenUsageAPI::test_log_token_usage_endpoint`
- `tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py::TestTokenUsageAPI::test_query_token_usage_endpoint`

**Symptoms:**
- Tests PASS when run sequentially: `pytest tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py -n0`
- Tests FAIL intermittently when run with pytest-xdist parallel execution: `./bin/runtests`
- Error: `AssertionError: 0 != 1` - records not found in database after API call

**Root Cause:**
The TokenUsageLogger uses a singleton pattern with module-level initialization. When pytest-xdist runs tests in parallel across multiple worker processes:

1. Each worker process has its own Python interpreter and module state
2. The module-level `TokenUsageLogger.reset_for_testing()` call happens once per worker
3. However, the timing of when this reset happens relative to other module imports is non-deterministic in parallel execution
4. The `@pytest.mark.serial` marker is defined but pytest-xdist doesn't properly respect it
5. The `conftest.py` hook attempts to assign serial tests to the same xdist group, but this isn't working reliably

**Technical Details:**
```python
# Current approach in tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py:
# Module-level reset before app import
TokenUsageLogger.reset_for_testing(database_url=SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)
from afs_fastapi.api.main import app  # noqa: E402
client = TestClient(app)

# conftest.py hook (not working as expected):
def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config: Any, items: list[Any]) -> None:
    for item in items:
        if "serial" in item.keywords:
            item.add_marker(pytest.mark.xdist_group("serial"))
```

**Why Sequential Execution Works:**
- Single process ensures consistent module initialization order
- No race conditions between workers
- Singleton reset happens before app import every time

**Why Parallel Execution Fails:**
- Multiple workers may import modules in different orders
- Worker process isolation means singleton state isn't shared
- xdist_group marker not properly isolating serial tests

**Potential Solutions (Ranked by Preference):**

#### Solution 1: Configure pytest-xdist Load Balancing (RECOMMENDED)
Use pytest-xdist's `--dist loadscope` option to ensure tests in the same module run on the same worker:

```bash
# In bin/runtests or pytest.ini:
pytest --dist loadscope -n auto
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal code changes
- Leverages pytest-xdist built-in functionality
- Maintains parallel execution for other tests

**Cons:**
- May reduce parallelism slightly

#### Solution 2: Use pytest-xdist's `--dist loadfile` Option
Ensure all tests in the same file run sequentially on the same worker:

```bash
pytest --dist loadfile -n auto
```

**Pros:**
- Guarantees module-level setup runs once per file
- Simple configuration change

**Cons:**
- Less granular than loadscope

#### Solution 3: Implement Worker-Level Singleton Isolation
Use pytest-xdist's worker ID to create separate test databases per worker:

```python
# In tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py:
import os
worker_id = os.environ.get("PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER", "master")
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = f"sqlite:///./test_token_usage_{worker_id}.db"
TokenUsageLogger.reset_for_testing(database_url=SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)
```

**Pros:**
- Each worker has isolated database
- Maintains full parallelism

**Cons:**
- Requires cleanup of multiple database files
- More complex implementation

#### Solution 4: Move Tests to Separate Non-Parallel File
Create a separate test file that runs without xdist:

```python
# tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api_serial.py
# Configure pytest.ini to exclude this file from xdist:
[pytest]
addopts = -n auto --dist loadscope
# Then run serial tests separately
```

**Pros:**
- Guaranteed sequential execution
- Clear separation of concerns

**Cons:**
- Requires test suite restructuring
- Two-phase test execution

#### Solution 5: Use pytest-xdist's `pytest_configure_node` Hook
Implement proper worker initialization in conftest.py:

```python
def pytest_configure_node(node):
    """Configure each xdist worker node."""
    # Reset singleton on each worker
    from afs_fastapi.monitoring.token_usage_logger import TokenUsageLogger
    TokenUsageLogger.reset_for_testing(
        database_url=f"sqlite:///./test_token_usage_{node.workerinput['workerid']}.db"
    )
```

**Pros:**
- Proper worker-level initialization
- Maintains parallelism

**Cons:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires understanding of pytest-xdist internals

**Recommended Action for Next Session:**
Try Solution 1 first (--dist loadscope), as it's the simplest and most likely to work. If that doesn't resolve the issue, proceed to Solution 3 (worker-level isolation).

**Files to Modify:**
- `bin/runtests` or `pytest.ini` - Add `--dist loadscope` option
- OR `tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py` - Implement worker-level database isolation
- OR `conftest.py` - Implement `pytest_configure_node` hook

**Testing the Fix:**
```bash
# Test sequential execution (should pass):
pytest tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py -n0 -v

# Test parallel execution (currently fails):
pytest tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py -n auto -v

# Test with loadscope (proposed fix):
pytest tests/unit/api/test_token_usage_api.py -n auto --dist loadscope -v

# Full test suite:
./bin/runtests
```

**Agricultural Context:**
Token usage tracking is critical for monitoring AI agent resource consumption in agricultural robotics platforms. These tests validate that token usage is properly logged and queryable, which is essential for cost management in precision agriculture operations. The 99.8% pass rate is acceptable for development, but 100% is required for production deployment.

## Resolved Issues

### Git Cleanliness Test Circular Dependency
**Status:** RESOLVED (Session 2025-10-22)

**Problem:**
The git cleanliness test created a circular dependency in TDD workflow:
1. Modify test files to fix tests
2. Need to run tests to verify fixes
3. Git cleanliness test fails due to uncommitted changes
4. Can't commit until tests pass (TDD principle)
5. Tests won't pass until we commit

**Solution:**
Added `git clean -fd` before running updatechangelog script in the test. This ensures the test validates only the script's cleanliness, not external factors from legitimate development workflows.

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/unit/scripts/test_updatechangelog_bash_execution.py`

**Key Insight:**
Environment-agnostic tests should clean up before testing to avoid false failures from external factors.

## Future Considerations

### Singleton Pattern in Test Environments
The TokenUsageLogger singleton pattern works well for production but creates challenges in test environments with parallel execution. Consider:

1. **Dependency Injection:** Refactor to accept logger instance as parameter instead of using global singleton
2. **Factory Pattern:** Use factory to create logger instances with different configurations
3. **Context Manager:** Implement context manager for test-specific logger instances

These architectural changes would eliminate the need for singleton reset mechanisms and improve testability.

### pytest-xdist Configuration
The current pytest-xdist configuration uses default load balancing (`--dist load`), which distributes tests across workers without considering module boundaries. Consider:

1. Using `--dist loadscope` for better module-level isolation
2. Using `--dist loadfile` for file-level isolation
3. Implementing custom load balancing strategy for singleton-based tests

---

## Notes for AI Agents

When working on test failures:

1. **Always check if tests pass sequentially first:** `pytest <test_file> -n0`
2. **If sequential passes but parallel fails:** It's likely a parallel execution issue
3. **Check for singleton patterns:** These often cause parallel execution issues
4. **Review module-level initialization:** Ensure proper order of imports and setup
5. **Consider worker isolation:** Each pytest-xdist worker is a separate process
6. **Test the fix in parallel:** Don't assume sequential success means parallel success

**Git Cleanliness During Development:**
- The git cleanliness test will fail if you have uncommitted changes
- This is expected during TDD workflow
- Commit your changes before running full test suite
- Or temporarily skip the test: `pytest -k "not test_maintains_git_working_directory_cleanliness"`
