feat(todos): Overhaul TODOs system for hierarchical management

This commit introduces a major overhaul of the TODOs system to provide a more structured and robust workflow for managing development tasks. The new system is based on a three-level hierarchy of Strategic Goals, Phases, and Tasks, and includes a comprehensive set of command-line scripts for managing them.

Key features and changes:

- **Hierarchical Data Structure:**
  - A single `todos.json` file now stores all TODOs in a hierarchical structure, replacing the old `strategic_todos.json` and `phase_todos.json` files.

- **Centralized Logic:**
  - A new `todos_manager.py` module encapsulates all the logic for interacting with the `todos.json` file, providing a consistent API for all scripts.

- **Comprehensive CRUD Operations:**
  - All `strategic-*`, `phase-*`, and new `task-*` scripts have been rewritten in Python to use the `todos_manager`.
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and reordering functionality is now available for all three levels of the TODOs hierarchy.

- **Pause/Resume Functionality:**
  - Added the ability to pause and resume strategic goals, phases, and tasks, with cascading status updates to parent items.

- **Simplified Session Management:**
  - The `loadsession` script now reads a summary from `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`.
  - The `savesession` script generates the `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` file with a summary of the current TODOs state.
  - The `todo-restore` and `todo-handoff` scripts have been deleted as they are now redundant.

- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - A new test suite for the `todos_manager.py` module has been added at `tests/core/test_todos_manager.py`, ensuring the reliability of the new system.

- **User Documentation:**
  - A new `docs/TODO_SYSTEM.md` file provides a comprehensive guide to using the new TODOs system.

This overhaul provides a more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly system for managing the development workflow of the AFS FastAPI project, ensuring that all tasks are aligned with the strategic goals and that the project's state is always clear and accessible.
