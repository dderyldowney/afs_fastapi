# ToDoWrite System Migration Report

## Date: 2025-10-19

## Overview

This report details the process of migrating legacy ToDoWrite data to the new 12-layer ToDoWrite system and the subsequent validation of the project's current state.

## Migration Process

The migration process was initiated by searching for a legacy `todos.json` file in the `.claude/` directory, as specified in the `ToDoWrite.md` documentation.

**Command Executed:**
```bash
glob --path /Users/dderyldowney/Documents/GitHub/dderyldowney/afs_fastapi/ --pattern .claude/todos.json
```

**Result:**
No `todos.json` file was found. This indicates that there was no existing legacy JSON data to migrate using the `migrate_todowrite.py` tool. Therefore, no explicit data migration was performed.

## Validation of Current ToDoWrite State

Despite the absence of legacy data, a comprehensive validation of the current ToDoWrite system's state was performed to ensure adherence to the `ToDoWrite.md` specification and the `afs_fastapi/todos/manager.py` schema.

### 1. Schema Validation

**Command Executed:**
```bash
make tw-validate
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Validating YAML files against schema...
⚠️  No YAML files found in plans
✅ Schema validation completed
```
The validation completed successfully, confirming that if any YAML files were present in the `plans/` directory, they would be validated against the `todowrite.schema.json`. The warning "No YAML files found in plans" is expected, as no migration occurred to create these files.

### 2. Separation of Concerns (SoC) Linting

**Command Executed:**
```bash
make tw-lint
```

**Result:**
```
🔍 Linting for SoC violations...
✅ No SoC violations found!
📄 Report written to trace/lint_report.json
✅ SoC linting completed
```
The SoC linting completed successfully, indicating no violations. This is also expected due to the absence of YAML files in the `plans/` directory.

### 3. Traceability Matrix and Graph Generation

**Command Executed:**
```bash
make tw-trace
```

**Result:**
```
🔗 Building traceability matrix...
🔍 Loading 0 YAML files...
📊 Loaded 0 nodes
📄 Traceability matrix written to trace/trace.csv
📊 Dependency graph written to trace/graph.json

✅ Traceability validation passed!

📊 Traceability Summary:
   Nodes: 0
   Matrix entries: 0
   Graph edges: 0
✅ Traceability analysis completed
```
The traceability analysis completed successfully, confirming that no nodes were loaded, which is consistent with the absence of YAML files.

## Identified Discrepancies

No discrepancies were identified during this process, as there was no legacy data to migrate and the current system, in its empty state, passed all validation checks.

## Summary of Current ToDoWrite System Status

*   **Legacy Data Migration**: Not applicable, as no `todos.json` file was found.
*   **Schema Validation**: Passed (no YAML files to validate, but the mechanism is functional).
*   **SoC Linting**: Passed (no YAML files to lint).
*   **Traceability Analysis**: Passed (no nodes to trace).

The ToDoWrite system is currently in a clean state, ready for new goals, phases, steps, tasks, and subtasks to be added according to the 12-layer specification.
