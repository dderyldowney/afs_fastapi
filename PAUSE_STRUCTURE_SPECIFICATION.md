# AFS FastAPI Pause Structure Specification

## Purpose

This document defines the mandatory **Recommended Pause Structure for Session Optimization** that must be followed by ALL agents and humans working on the AFS FastAPI agricultural robotics platform.

## Mandatory Compliance

**CRITICAL**: This pause structure is MANDATORY for all contributors:
- ✅ **All AI agents** (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- ✅ **All human developers**
- ✅ **All session types** (development, debugging, documentation)
- ✅ **All work contexts** (features, bug fixes, refactoring)

## Pause Structure Framework

### 1. Task-Level Pauses (Micro-Pauses)

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS:**
- After completing TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- After all quality gates pass (Black, Ruff, isort, MyPy, pre-commit hooks)
- After successful git commit with quality validation
- Before starting context-heavy integration work
- Every 2-3 completed tasks within a phase

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
# Execute after each completed task
./bin/pause-here "Task: [TASK_NAME] - [BRIEF_STATUS]" "[NEXT_STEP_DESCRIPTION]"
```

**EXAMPLE:**
```bash
./bin/pause-here "Task: Advanced Message Prioritization - Completed with full TDD coverage" "Ready to implement network congestion detection system"
```

### 2. Phase-Level Pauses (Major Pauses)

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS:**
- End of each development phase (6-task completion)
- After completing functional unit with full test coverage
- At architectural review points
- Before switching development focus areas

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
# Execute at phase completion
./bin/phase-end
./bin/pause-here "Phase: [PHASE_NAME] - Complete" "Ready for next phase: [NEXT_PHASE_NAME]"
```

**EXAMPLE:**
```bash
./bin/phase-end
./bin/pause-here "Phase: CAN Network Traffic Management - Complete with full test coverage" "Ready for next phase: Physical CAN Interface Integration"
```

### 3. Strategic Milestone Pauses (Critical Pauses)

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS:**
- After completing strategic goals from strategic-list
- Major platform capability completion
- Production readiness validation points
- Before major architectural changes

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
# Execute at strategic completion
./bin/strategic-complete "Strategic Goal Description"
./bin/saveandpush "Strategic milestone: [DESCRIPTION]"
./bin/pause-here "Strategic: [GOAL_NAME] - Complete" "Ready for next strategic objective: [NEXT_GOAL]"
```

## Session Limit Management

### Mandatory Triggers

**TIME-BASED TRIGGERS:**
- **Target**: Maximum 3-hour development sessions
- **Warning**: At 2.5-hour mark, complete current task and pause
- **Hard Stop**: At 3-hour mark, immediate pause regardless of task state

**CONTEXT-BASED TRIGGERS:**
- Session context approaching complexity limits
- Before starting multi-file complex integrations
- When switching between different architectural concerns
- Before major refactoring efforts

**QUALITY-BASED TRIGGERS:**
- After any test failures that require extensive debugging
- Before implementing features requiring research/analysis
- After completing any infrastructure changes

### Implementation Commands

**EMERGENCY PAUSE** (immediate session preservation):
```bash
./bin/pause-here "Emergency: Session limit approaching" "Resume with current context preserved"
```

**PLANNED PAUSE** (optimal development breakpoint):
```bash
./bin/saveandpush "Completed work before strategic pause"
./bin/pause-here "Planned: [REASON]" "[NEXT_STEPS]"
```

## Quality Gate Integration

### Pre-Pause Quality Requirements

**MANDATORY CHECKS** (must pass before any pause):
1. ✅ All tests passing: `pytest --tb=short`
2. ✅ Code formatting: `black --check`
3. ✅ Linting: `ruff check`
4. ✅ Type checking: `mypy`
5. ✅ Import sorting: `isort --check`
6. ✅ Git status clean: `git status`

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
```bash
# Automated quality check before pause
./bin/quality-check-and-pause "[PAUSE_REASON]" "[NEXT_STEPS]"
```

### Post-Pause Quality Assurance

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION** (after resuming):
1. ✅ Load session context: `./bin/loadsession`
2. ✅ Verify test suite: `pytest --tb=short`
3. ✅ Check git status: `git status`
4. ✅ Validate project state: `./bin/phase-status`, `./bin/strategic-status`

## Context Preservation Requirements

### Pause Context Documentation

**MANDATORY FIELDS** for all pause points:
- **Timestamp**: Exact pause time with timezone
- **Git Hash**: Current commit hash for resumption
- **Task Status**: Current progress within active task
- **Phase Status**: Progress within current development phase
- **Strategic Status**: Progress toward strategic goals
- **Next Steps**: Clear, actionable resumption instructions
- **Dependencies**: Any external dependencies or blockers
- **Quality State**: Last quality gate passage confirmation

### Context File Format

```markdown
# Pause Point Context: [PAUSE_ID]

**Reason:** [DETAILED_PAUSE_REASON]
**Timestamp:** [ISO_TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE]
**Git Hash:** [FULL_COMMIT_HASH]
**Current Phase:** [PHASE_NAME]

## Task Progress

## Quality Status
- [X] All tests passing
- [X] Code formatted (Black)
- [X] Linting clean (Ruff)
- [X] Types valid (MyPy)
- [X] Imports sorted (isort)

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Agent Enforcement

**AI AGENTS MUST:**
1. Check session duration before starting new tasks
2. Execute pause structure automatically at trigger points
3. Refuse to continue work past 3-hour sessions without pause
4. Validate quality gates before every pause
5. Create detailed context documentation for every pause

### Human Enforcement

**HUMAN DEVELOPERS MUST:**
1. Follow identical pause structure as AI agents
2. Use provided pause commands and tools
3. Document context thoroughly before pauses
4. Validate quality gates before commits
5. Resume using formal resumption procedures

### Automated Enforcement

**SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT:**
```bash
# Pre-commit hook integration
# File: .git/hooks/pre-commit-pause-validation
if [[ session_duration > 3_hours ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Session exceeds 3 hours. Execute pause before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```

**CONTINUOUS ENFORCEMENT:**
- Session monitoring with automatic warnings
- Git hook integration for pause validation
- Quality gate enforcement at pause points
- Automated context preservation validation

## Tools and Commands
