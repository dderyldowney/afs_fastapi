### Rationale
This session implemented automated CHANGELOG.md enforcement following Test-First Development methodology. After documenting CHANGELOG.md as MANDATORY in SESSION_SUMMARY.md, the requirement needed active enforcement via pre-commit hook to ensure compliance. The 9-test comprehensive suite validates all scenarios: rejection without CHANGELOG.md, acceptance with CHANGELOG.md, agricultural context error messages, merge commit exceptions, and git workflow integration. Automated enforcement ensures complete version history tracking essential for ISO 18497/11783 compliance auditing and safety-critical agricultural robotics platform documentation.
