# Agent Enforcement System - Portable Package

⚡ **Deploy KIS, PEP, TDD, and zero-artifact requirements to any Python project in seconds!**

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# From your project directory
python AGENT_ENFORCEMENT_PACKAGE.py .
```

### Option 2: Bash Script

```bash
# From your project directory
./deploy_agent_enforcement.sh .
```

### Option 3: Python Script with Target Path

```bash
# From anywhere
python AGENT_ENFORCEMENT_PACKAGE.py /path/to/your/project
```

## What This Does

✅ **Binds all agents to non-negotiable requirements:**
- KIS (Keep It Simple) principles
- PEP compliance (ALL PEPs)
- CLI tool usage before reading files
- TDD Red-Green-Refactor methodology
- Zero artifact cleanup in tests

✅ **Cannot be bypassed or ignored** - uses Python's auto-import mechanism

✅ **Works automatically** - no configuration needed

✅ **Future-proof** - all future agent sessions will be bound by these rules

## Files Included

- `KIS_DIRECTIVE.md` - Master directive document
- `__agent_enforcer__.py` - Critical enforcement system
