# Cloud Integration for AFS FastAPI

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details for integrating AFS FastAPI with various agricultural cloud platforms. The primary goal is to enable seamless data exchange, telemetry streaming, and remote command capabilities for agricultural robotics.

## Key Features

*   **Data Ingestion**: Securely ingest sensor data, equipment telemetry, and operational logs from robotic systems to the cloud.
*   **Command & Control**: Receive commands and mission plans from cloud platforms to direct robotic operations.
*   **Data Synchronization**: Ensure consistency of critical agricultural data (e.g., field boundaries, yield maps) between local systems and the cloud.
*   **Security**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and encryption for all cloud communications.

## Architecture

The cloud integration module (`afs_fastapi/services/cloud_integration.py`) acts as an intermediary between the core AFS FastAPI system and external cloud providers. It will utilize specific cloud provider SDKs or APIs to facilitate communication.

## Configuration

Cloud integration settings will be managed via `afs_fastapi/config.py` and potentially environment variables, including:

*   `CLOUD_PLATFORM_TYPE`: e.g., `AWS_IOT`, `AZURE_IOT_HUB`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_IOT_CORE`
*   `CLOUD_API_ENDPOINT`: The base URL for the cloud service API.
*   `CLOUD_API_KEY`: Authentication key or token for API access.
*   `CLOUD_REGION`: Geographical region of the cloud service.

## Usage

To utilize the cloud integration service:

1.  **Initialize**: Create an instance of `CloudIntegrationService` with the appropriate configuration.
2.  **Connect**: Call the `connect()` method to establish a secure connection.
3.  **Exchange Data**: Use `send_telemetry_data()` to push data to the cloud and `receive_commands()` to pull commands.
4.  **Disconnect**: Close the connection with `disconnect()` when no longer needed.

## Future Enhancements

*   Support for additional agricultural cloud platforms.
*   Advanced data analytics and machine learning integration in the cloud.
*   Real-time visualization of robotic fleet data on cloud dashboards.
