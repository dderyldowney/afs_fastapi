## 🎯 Executive Summary

**POLICY**: All future development on the AFS FastAPI agricultural robotics platform MUST follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. This framework establishes mandatory Red-Green-Refactor practices to ensure bulletproof reliability for safety-critical agricultural systems.

**UNIVERSAL APPLICATION**: This requirement applies to ALL contributors—human developers AND all AI agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini Code Assist, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and any future AI development assistant).

**ENFORCEMENT**: Automated pre-commit hooks validate TDD compliance before any code changes are accepted.

**INVESTIGATION PATTERN**: All substantive responses explaining code behavior, debugging issues, or analyzing system architecture MUST follow structured investigation pattern (see [INVESTIGATION_PATTERN_MANDATORY.md](../../.claude/INVESTIGATION_PATTERN_MANDATORY.md)).

## 📜 TDD Mandate for Agricultural Robotics

### Policy Statement

**Effective immediately**, all new features, bug fixes, and enhancements to the AFS FastAPI platform SHALL follow Test-Driven Development methodology:

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing test describing desired agricultural behavior
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimal code to satisfy test requirements
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage

### Universal AI Agent Compliance

**ALL AI development assistants** generating code for this platform MUST follow TDD methodology:

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic): Must write tests before implementation code
- **GitHub Copilot** (Microsoft/OpenAI): Must generate test-driven code patterns
- **ChatGPT Code Interpreter** (OpenAI): Must follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR workflow
- **Gemini Code Assist** (Google): Must validate test coverage before code generation
- **Amazon CodeWhisperer** (AWS): Must adhere to test-first development practices
- **Any Future AI Agent**: Must comply with mandatory TDD framework

**Rationale for Universal AI Compliance**: Safety-critical agricultural robotics cannot differentiate code quality by generation method—whether written by human developers or AI assistants, ALL code must meet identical verification standards to ensure ISO 18497/11783 compliance.

### Justification for Mandatory TDD

**Agricultural Safety Requirements**:
- Multi-tractor coordination cannot tolerate system failures during field operations
- ISO 18497 safety compliance requires comprehensive validation
- Autonomous equipment operations demand verified reliability
- Emergency stop systems must function correctly across entire fleet

**Distributed Systems Complexity**:
- Vector clocks and CRDTs require mathematical correctness validation
- Network partition handling needs comprehensive edge case testing
- ISOBUS message queuing demands guaranteed delivery verification
- Performance constraints of embedded equipment require validated optimization

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Framework

### Mandatory TDD Workflow

#### Phase 1: RED (Write Failing Test)

```bash
# REQUIRED: Create test file before implementation
touch tests/unit/services/test_new_component.py

# REQUIRED: Write failing test with agricultural context
pytest tests/unit/services/test_new_component.py::TestNewComponent::test_core_functionality -v
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: FAILED (test describes desired behavior)
```

**Red Phase Requirements**:
- Test must include agricultural context in docstring
- Performance constraints must be validated for equipment limitations
- Safety scenarios must be covered for critical components
- Edge cases relevant to field operations must be tested

#### Phase 2: GREEN (Minimal Implementation)

```bash
# REQUIRED: Implement minimal code to pass test
pytest tests/unit/services/test_new_component.py::TestNewComponent::test_core_functionality -v
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: PASSED

# REQUIRED: Verify no regression in existing tests
pytest tests/unit/ -q
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: All tests pass
```

**Green Phase Requirements**:
- Implementation must satisfy test requirements exactly
- No additional functionality beyond test requirements
- Code must pass all quality checks (ruff, mypy, black)
- Performance requirements must be met

#### Phase 3: REFACTOR (Quality Enhancement)

```bash
# REQUIRED: Maintain test coverage during refactoring
pytest tests/unit/services/test_new_component.py -v
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: All tests continue passing

# REQUIRED: Quality validation
ruff check afs_fastapi/services/ --select=ALL
mypy afs_fastapi/services/ --strict
black afs_fastapi/services/
# EXPECTED OUTPUT: Zero warnings/errors
```

**Refactor Phase Requirements**:
- All tests must continue passing
- Code quality must improve without changing behavior
- Performance optimizations validated through benchmarks
- Documentation updated to reflect changes

## 🚨 Enforcement Mechanisms

### Pre-Commit Hook Validation

**Automated TDD Compliance Checking**:
- `.claude/hooks/tdd_enforcement.py` validates Red-Green-Refactor compliance
- `.claude/hooks/safety_validation.py` ensures ISO 18497 safety standards
- `pytest` execution validates all tests pass before commit

**Enforcement Rules**:
1. New source files MUST have corresponding test files
2. Modified files MUST show recent test activity
3. Critical components MUST have comprehensive test coverage
4. All tests MUST pass before code changes are accepted

### Quality Gates

**MANDATORY Pre-Commit Validation**:
```bash
# These commands MUST pass before any commit is accepted:
pytest --tb=short -q                           # All tests pass
ruff check afs_fastapi/ --select=ALL          # Zero linting warnings
mypy afs_fastapi/ --strict                    # Complete type safety
black --check afs_fastapi/                    # Code formatting compliance
```

**Failed Validation Response**:
- Commit is blocked until TDD compliance is achieved
- Developer must return to RED phase for proper test-first development
- Safety-critical violations require immediate remediation
