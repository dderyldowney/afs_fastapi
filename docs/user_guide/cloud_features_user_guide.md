# User Guide: Cloud Features for Agricultural Engineers

## Overview

This user guide provides agricultural engineers with instructions on how to configure and utilize the cloud integration features within the AFS FastAPI platform. These features enable seamless data exchange with cloud platforms, enhancing operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making.

## Prerequisites

*   Access to an AFS FastAPI instance with the cloud integration module enabled.
*   Valid credentials (API keys, user accounts) for the target agricultural cloud platform (e.g., John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView).
*   Basic understanding of cloud concepts and data management.

## Configuration

To configure cloud features, you will need to provide specific credentials and settings. This is typically done via environment variables or a configuration file (`config.py`).

1.  **Cloud Platform Selection**:
    *   Specify the `CLOUD_PLATFORM_TYPE` (e.g., `AWS_IOT`, `AZURE_IOT_HUB`).

2.  **API Endpoint**:
    *   Provide the `CLOUD_API_ENDPOINT` for your chosen cloud service.

3.  **Authentication Credentials**:
    *   Set `CLOUD_API_KEY` or other relevant authentication tokens securely.

**Example Configuration (Environment Variables)**:

```bash
export CLOUD_PLATFORM_TYPE="AWS_IOT"
export CLOUD_API_ENDPOINT="https://iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
export CLOUD_API_KEY="your_secure_aws_iot_api_key"
```

## Using Cloud Features

### 1. Telemetry Data Upload

AFS FastAPI automatically collects and uploads telemetry data (e.g., sensor readings, equipment status, GPS location) from your robotic systems to the configured cloud platform. This data can be used for:

*   Real-time monitoring of fleet operations.
*   Historical analysis of performance and efficiency.
*   Integration with third-party analytics tools.

### 2. Remote Command and Control

Commands issued from your agricultural cloud platform can be received by AFS FastAPI and relayed to your robotic systems. This enables:

*   Remote initiation of tasks (e.g., start planting, begin spraying).
*   Real-time adjustments to mission plans.
*   Emergency stop functionalities.

### 3. Field Data Synchronization

Critical field data, such as field boundaries and prescription maps, can be synchronized between AFS FastAPI and your cloud platform. This ensures:

*   Consistent data across all your agricultural management tools.
*   Up-to-date information for robotic navigation and task execution.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **Data Not Appearing in Cloud**: Verify network connectivity, check AFS FastAPI logs for upload errors, and ensure cloud platform credentials are correct.
*   **Commands Not Reaching Robots**: Confirm cloud platform is sending commands correctly, check AFS FastAPI logs for command reception errors, and verify robot connectivity.
*   **Synchronization Discrepancies**: Review synchronization logs for conflict resolution details. Ensure data models are consistent.
