# Documentation Plan for AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform

## 1. Scope of Documentation

This documentation aims to provide comprehensive guidance for users interacting with the AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform. It will cover:

*   **Platform Tools**: Usage and purpose of command-line interface (CLI) tools located in the `bin/` directory (e.g., `savesession`, `saveandpush`, `todo-status`, `phase-status`, `strategic-list`, `formatall`).
*   **Environment and Tooling**: Setup and configuration of the development environment, including dependency management, virtual environments, pre-commit hooks, testing procedures (`pytest`), and code quality tools (`black`, `ruff`, `isort`, `mypy`).
*   **`afs_fastapi` Python Module**: Detailed API reference, core concepts, and usage examples for the Python modules within the `afs_fastapi/` directory, covering equipment control, monitoring, and API interactions.

## 2. Target Audience Needs

The documentation is tailored for a diverse audience with varying levels of technical expertise and roles within the agricultural robotics and AI domain:

*   **Agricultural Engineers**: Primarily interested in the practical application of the platform, understanding how to configure and operate agricultural equipment, interpret sensor data, and utilize fleet coordination features. They will need clear, concise instructions and real-world examples relevant to farming operations.

*   **Agricultural Robotics Engineers**: Focused on integrating, extending, and maintaining the robotics aspects of the platform. They will require detailed explanations of hardware interfaces, control systems, safety protocols, and the interaction between software components and physical machinery. API references and code examples will be crucial.

*   **Artificial Intelligence Engineers**: Concerned with the AI processing pipeline, data analysis, and integration of AI models. They will need documentation on data formats, API endpoints for AI services, optimization strategies, and how to leverage the platform for AI-driven agricultural tasks. Explanations of the underlying AI architecture and data flows will be important.

## 3. Key Considerations

*   **Clarity and Conciseness**: Information must be easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary jargon where possible, and providing clear explanations for technical terms.
*   **Practical Examples**: Include numerous code snippets, command-line examples, and use-case scenarios relevant to agricultural robotics and AI applications.
*   **Accessibility**: Ensure the documentation is easily navigable and searchable.
*   **Maintainability**: Structure the documentation in a way that is easy to update and expand as the project evolves.
*   **Agricultural Context**: Throughout the documentation, emphasize the relevance and application of features within the agricultural robotics domain, aligning with ISO 11783/18497 compliance where applicable.

## 4. Documentation Structure

The documentation will be organized into the following main sections:

### 4.1. Getting Started
*   Introduction to the AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform
*   Quick Start Guide
*   Installation and Setup (Environment & Tooling)

### 4.2. Platform Tools
*   Overview of CLI Tools
*   Detailed Usage Guides for each `bin/` script (e.g., `savesession`, `saveandpush`, `todo-status`, `phase-status`, `strategic-list`, `formatall`)
*   Command-line Examples

### 4.3. Development Environment
*   Dependency Management
*   Virtual Environments
*   Pre-commit Hooks (Explanation and Usage)
*   Testing (Running `pytest`, Interpreting Reports)
*   Code Quality (Formatting with `black`, Linting with `ruff`, Import Sorting with `isort`, Type Checking with `mypy`)

### 4.4. `afs_fastapi` Python Module Reference
*   Core Concepts and Architecture
*   API Reference for `afs_fastapi.equipment`
*   API Reference for `afs_fastapi.monitoring`
*   API Reference for `afs_fastapi.api`
*   API Reference for other key modules
*   Code Examples and Use Cases (e.g., controlling tractors, fetching sensor data, interacting with APIs)

### 4.5. Agricultural Robotics & AI Context
*   Glossary of Agricultural Robotics and AI Terms
*   Compliance Standards (ISO 11783, ISO 18497)
*   Best Practices for Agricultural AI Development

### 4.6. Contributing
*   How to Contribute to the Project
*   Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Features

## 5. Documentation Format and Tools

To ensure maintainability, accessibility, and a professional appearance, the documentation will utilize the following:

*   **Format**: reStructuredText (`.rst`) or Markdown (`.md`) for content creation. Given the prevalence of Markdown and its ease of use, Markdown will be the primary format.
*   **Static Site Generator**: Sphinx, a powerful documentation generator that can process both reStructuredText and Markdown (via MyST-Parser). Sphinx provides excellent cross-referencing, indexing, and theme capabilities.
*   **Hosting**: Read the Docs, a platform that automates the building, hosting, and versioning of documentation generated by Sphinx. This will provide a publicly accessible and easily navigable documentation portal.
*   **Version Control**: All documentation source files will be managed under Git, ensuring version control and collaborative editing.

## 6. Writing Guidelines and Style Guide

To maintain consistency and quality across the documentation, the following guidelines will be adhered to:

*   **Tone**: Professional, clear, and concise. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, but use precise technical language when necessary.
*   **Voice**: Use an active voice. Address the reader directly ("You should...", "To do X, follow these steps...").
*   **Formatting**:
    *   Use Markdown for all content.
    *   Headings: Use `#` for top-level sections, `##` for subsections, and so on.
    *   Code Blocks: Use triple backticks (`````) with language specifiers (e.g., `python`, `bash`).
    *   Inline Code: Use single backticks (`` ` ``).
    *   Bold: Use `**text**` for emphasis.
    *   Italics: Use `*text*` for file names, URLs, or terms being defined.
    *   Lists: Use ordered lists for sequential steps, unordered lists for general items.
*   **Terminology**:
    *   Use consistent terminology throughout. Maintain a glossary for key terms.
    *   Refer to the platform as "AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform" or "the platform".
    *   Refer to CLI tools by their exact names (e.g., `savesession`).
*   **Examples**: All code examples should be functional, tested, and clearly explained.
*   **Accuracy**: Ensure all technical information, commands, and code snippets are accurate and up-to-date.
*   **Accessibility**: Use clear and descriptive language. Provide alternative text for images if any are included.
