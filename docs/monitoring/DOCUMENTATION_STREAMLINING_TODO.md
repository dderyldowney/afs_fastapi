  - Removed redundant AI agent enumerations (replaced with "ALL AI agents" + reference)
  - Removed redundant agricultural context sections (centralized in SESSION_SUMMARY.md)
  - Condensed verbose usage scenarios to concise 2-3 line summaries
  - Preserved complete specifications for automation compatibility

**Validation Criteria**:
- [x] All 7 commands documented in SESSION_SUMMARY.md with enhanced details
- [x] Cross-references functional from CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (verified with grep)
- [x] Universal specs compressed 75% while maintaining automation compatibility
