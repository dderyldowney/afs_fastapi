## CRITICAL: Session State Compaction

**⚠️  MANDATORY BEFORE CHANGES**: This session state snapshot was created with the understanding that session state MUST be compacted before applying any changes.

**Compaction Protocol**:
1. **Review this snapshot**: Understand current conceptual, contextual, and functional state
2. **Compact into SESSION_SUMMARY.md**: Move critical achievements to permanent record
3. **Archive old state**: Previous session state files can be archived or removed
4. **Begin new work**: Only after compaction is complete

**Rationale**: Session state snapshots capture point-in-time state with full detail. Without compaction, knowledge becomes fragmented across multiple snapshot files, making it difficult for future sessions (human or AI) to understand platform evolution. Compaction ensures SESSION_SUMMARY.md remains the authoritative, accessible source of truth.

## Functional State (How it works)

### Session Initialization Architecture

**Complete Documentation**: [docs/EXECUTION_ORDER.md](../EXECUTION_ORDER.md)

**6-Phase Architecture**:
1. Automatic Hook-Based Initialization
2. Manual Session Loading (bin/loadsession)
3. Conceptual Context Loading
4. Enforcement & Validation
5. Mandatory Requirement References
6. Helper Commands & Utilities

**Key Files**: 28+ files working together for session establishment

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Pre-Commit Hooks** (7 total):
1. Ruff (lint)
2. Black (format check)
3. isort (imports check)
4. MyPy (type check)
5. TDD Enforcement
6. Safety Standards Validation
7. CHANGELOG.md Enforcement

**Claude Code Hooks** (3 types):
1. SessionStart: session_initialization.py
2. PreToolUse: session_initialization.py, pre_tool_validation_wrapper.py
3. UserPromptSubmit: user_prompt_tdd_wrapper.py

## Next Session Actions

### CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Compact This State

**Before starting new work**:
1. Review this snapshot completely
2. Identify critical achievements to preserve
3. Update SESSION_SUMMARY.md with compacted knowledge
4. Archive or remove old session state snapshots
5. Verify SESSION_SUMMARY.md reflects current platform state

### Strategic Priorities
