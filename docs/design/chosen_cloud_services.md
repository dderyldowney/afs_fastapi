# Chosen Cloud Services for Agricultural Data Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the selection of appropriate cloud services for data ingestion and processing within the AFS FastAPI cloud integration module. The selection criteria prioritize scalability, reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness for agricultural robotics applications.

## Selected Cloud Services

1.  **AWS IoT Core (Amazon Web Services)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Primary service for ingesting telemetry data from robotic systems.
    *   **Features**: Supports MQTT protocol, device management, secure communication, and integration with other AWS services (e.g., Lambda, S3).
    *   **Rationale**: Robust, scalable, and widely adopted for IoT solutions, offering extensive features for device connectivity and data routing.

2.  **AWS Lambda (Amazon Web Services)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Serverless compute service for processing ingested data, triggering actions, and transforming data formats.
    *   **Features**: Event-driven execution, automatic scaling, and integration with AWS IoT Core and other data services.
    *   **Rationale**: Cost-effective for intermittent data processing, reduces operational overhead, and enables rapid development of data pipelines.

3.  **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Object storage for raw and processed agricultural data, including sensor logs, historical telemetry, and geospatial files.
    *   **Features**: High durability, availability, scalability, and various storage classes for cost optimization.
    *   **Rationale**: Industry-standard for cloud storage, ideal for large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data generated by agricultural robotics.

4.  **AWS DynamoDB (NoSQL Database)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Fast and flexible NoSQL database for storing real-time operational data, device states, and command queues.
    *   **Features**: High performance at any scale, fully managed, and supports key-value and document data models.
    *   **Rationale**: Suitable for high-throughput, low-latency data access required for real-time robotic operations and command processing.

## Integration Points

*   **Telemetry Ingestion**: Robotic systems will publish data to AWS IoT Core via MQTT. AWS IoT rules will then route data to Lambda for processing and S3/DynamoDB for storage.
*   **Command & Control**: Commands from cloud applications will be routed via AWS IoT Core to robotic systems or stored in DynamoDB for retrieval.

## Future Considerations

*   Explore other cloud providers (Azure IoT Hub, Google Cloud IoT Core) for multi-cloud strategies or specific regional requirements.
*   Evaluate managed data warehousing solutions (e.g., AWS Redshift) for advanced analytics on historical data.
