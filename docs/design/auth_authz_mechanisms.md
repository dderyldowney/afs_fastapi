# Authentication and Authorization for Secure Cloud Access

## Overview

This document details the design of authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access to agricultural cloud platforms from AFS FastAPI. Robust security is paramount to protect sensitive agricultural data and control robotic systems.

## Authentication Mechanisms

Authentication verifies the identity of the entity (AFS FastAPI instance, robotic system, or user) attempting to access cloud resources.

1.  **OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant**:
    *   **Purpose**: Ideal for server-to-server communication where AFS FastAPI acts as a client application accessing cloud APIs on behalf of itself.
    *   **Flow**: AFS FastAPI exchanges its client ID and client secret for an access token from the cloud provider's authorization server.
    *   **Token Usage**: The obtained access token is then used to authenticate API requests to cloud resources.

2.  **API Keys**:
    *   **Purpose**: For simpler integrations or services that do not support OAuth2, API keys can be used.
    *   **Management**: API keys must be treated as sensitive credentials, stored securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager), and rotated regularly.

3.  **X.509 Certificates (for IoT Devices)**:
    *   **Purpose**: For individual robotic systems connecting directly to cloud IoT hubs (e.g., AWS IoT Core), X.509 certificates provide strong device identity and mutual TLS authentication.
    *   **Provisioning**: Certificates will be securely provisioned to each robotic system.

## Authorization Mechanisms

Authorization determines what actions an authenticated entity is permitted to perform on cloud resources.

1.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    *   **Cloud-Side**: Cloud platforms will define roles (e.g., `TelemetryPublisher`, `CommandSubscriber`, `FieldDataEditor`) with specific permissions.
    *   **AFS FastAPI Role**: AFS FastAPI will assume roles with the minimum necessary permissions (principle of least privilege) to perform its functions.

2.  **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**:
    *   **Granularity**: Cloud providers often support fine-grained policies (e.g., AWS IAM policies) that can define permissions based on resource attributes, request conditions, and user/role attributes.
    *   **Implementation**: Policies will be crafted to restrict access to specific agricultural data sets, robotic systems, or geographical regions.

## Credential Management

*   **Secrets Manager**: Cloud-specific credentials (API keys, client secrets) will be stored in a secure secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).
*   **Environment Variables**: During development and for non-sensitive configurations, credentials may be loaded via environment variables.
*   **Rotation**: Implement automated rotation of API keys and client secrets.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Least Privilege**: Grant only the necessary permissions.
*   **Secure Storage**: Never hardcode credentials in source code.
*   **Auditing**: Enable logging and auditing of all access attempts and actions on cloud resources.
*   **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update authentication and authorization configurations.
