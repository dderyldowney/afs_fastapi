## 4. Interactive Prototyping and User Feedback

**Purpose:** To create low-fidelity to high-fidelity interactive prototypes that simulate the user experience, allowing for early and iterative user feedback before significant development effort. This helps in validating design decisions, identifying usability issues, and refining the UI/UX.

**Tools (Examples):**
*   **Low-Fidelity:** Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch (for wireframing and basic interactions).
*   **High-Fidelity:** Axure RP, Proto.io (for more complex interactions and realistic simulations).
*   **Code-based:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue) for highly interactive and functional prototypes.

**Process:**
1.  **Prototype Development:** Convert static mockups into interactive prototypes, focusing on key user flows and critical functionalities.
2.  **User Testing Sessions:** Conduct usability testing with target users (agricultural engineers and farmers) using the interactive prototypes.
    *   **Tasks:** Provide users with specific tasks to complete within the prototype.
    *   **Observation:** Observe user behavior, interactions, and verbal feedback.
    *   **Interviews:** Follow up with users to gather qualitative insights on their experience, pain points, and suggestions.
3.  **Feedback Analysis:** Analyze collected feedback to identify common themes, usability issues, and areas for improvement.
4.  **Design Iteration:** Incorporate feedback into design iterations, refining wireframes, mockups, and prototypes.
5.  **Validation:** Repeat testing with updated prototypes to validate design changes and ensure user satisfaction.
