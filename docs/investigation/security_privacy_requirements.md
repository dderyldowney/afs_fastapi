# Security and Privacy Requirements for Agricultural Cloud Data

## Overview

This document outlines the critical security and privacy requirements for integrating agricultural data with cloud platforms. Given the sensitive nature of agricultural operational data, robust measures are essential to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse.

## Security Requirements

1.  **Authentication and Authorization**:
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2, API keys) for all cloud interactions.
    *   Enforce granular authorization policies to ensure only authorized entities can access specific data or perform certain actions.
    *   Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.

2.  **Data Encryption**:
    *   Encrypt all data in transit (e.g., TLS 1.2/1.3) between AFS FastAPI and cloud platforms.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within cloud storage solutions.
    *   Manage encryption keys securely.

3.  **Access Control**:
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user and service permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit access logs.

4.  **Network Security**:
    *   Utilize virtual private clouds (VPCs) or private endpoints for cloud services.
    *   Implement firewalls and security groups to restrict network access.

5.  **Vulnerability Management**:
    *   Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure and application code.
    *   Promptly patch and update systems.

6.  **Incident Response**:
    *   Establish procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

## Privacy Requirements

1.  **Data Minimization**:
    *   Collect and store only the data necessary for the intended purpose.

2.  **Consent Management**:
    *   Obtain explicit consent from data owners (farmers) for data collection, storage, and sharing.
    *   Provide clear and transparent privacy policies.

3.  **Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization**:
    *   Anonymize or pseudonymize data where feasible, especially for analytical purposes.

4.  **Data Retention**:
    *   Define and enforce data retention policies, deleting data when it is no longer needed.

5.  **Compliance**:
    *   Adhere to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and agricultural data privacy principles.

## Recommendations

*   Leverage cloud provider security services (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD, Google Cloud IAM).
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests.
*   Ensure legal and ethical compliance with agricultural data handling.
