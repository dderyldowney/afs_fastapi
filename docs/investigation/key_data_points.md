# Key Data Points for Cloud Integration

## Overview

This document identifies the key data points that will be integrated with agricultural cloud platforms. These data points are crucial for monitoring, analysis, and control of robotic systems in agricultural operations.

## Categories of Data Points

1.  **Sensor Data**:
    *   Soil moisture levels
    *   Temperature (air, soil)
    *   Humidity
    *   Light intensity
    *   Nutrient levels (N, P, K)
    *   pH levels

2.  **Equipment Telemetry**:
    *   GPS coordinates (real-time location)
    *   Speed and direction
    *   Engine RPM and load
    *   Fuel consumption
    *   Implement status (e.g., planter downforce, sprayer pressure)
    *   Error codes and diagnostics

3.  **Field Boundaries and Geospatial Data**:
    *   Field polygons (shapefiles, GeoJSON)
    *   Headland boundaries
    *   Obstacle locations
    *   Elevation data

4.  **Yield Data**:
    *   Yield per unit area
    *   Moisture content of harvested crop
    *   Harvest date and time

5.  **Application Data**:
    *   Variable rate application maps (seeding, fertilizer, pesticide)
    *   As-applied data (actual application rates)

## Data Formats and Standards

Data will primarily be exchanged in JSON format. Consideration will be given to agricultural data standards such as ISOXML for compatibility with existing farm management information systems (FMIS).
