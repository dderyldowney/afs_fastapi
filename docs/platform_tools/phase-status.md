# `phase-status` Command Documentation

## Purpose

The `phase-status` command provides a detailed overview of the current active development phase within the AFS FastAPI Dual TODO System. It displays the progress of the phase, its individual steps, and estimated time remaining, offering granular insight into the immediate development focus.

## Usage

To view the status of the current development phase, execute the `phase-status` command from your project's root directory:

```bash
./bin/phase-status
```

## Key Features

*   **Current Phase Details**: Displays the name, description, start time, and strategic alignment of the active phase.
*   **Phase Progress**: Shows the total, completed, in-progress, and pending steps within the phase, along with a progress bar.
*   **Phase Steps**: Lists each individual step of the phase, including its ID, content, status, creation date, priority, and estimated time.
*   **Estimated Time Remaining**: Provides an approximate time needed to complete the remaining steps in the phase.
*   **Phase Planning**: Offers guidance on next steps, such as adding new implementation steps or completing the phase.
*   **Command Reference**: Lists related commands for managing phase steps (e.g., `phase-add`, `phase-complete`, `phase-end`).

## Agricultural Context

In the context of the AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform, `phase-status` is crucial for:

*   **Micro-level Project Management**: Enabling precise tracking of progress within specific development initiatives, which is vital for managing complex features in agricultural robotics.
*   **Resource Allocation**: Helping to estimate and allocate resources effectively by providing clear visibility into the remaining work for a given phase.
*   **Agile Development**: Supporting agile methodologies by breaking down larger strategic objectives into manageable, trackable phase steps.
*   **Compliance Documentation**: Contributing to the detailed documentation required for compliance with agricultural safety standards (ISO 18497, ISO 11783) by providing a granular record of implementation progress.
