## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Enhanced Communication

**Legacy Operation (Maintained)**:
```python
# Existing functionality preserved
tractor = FarmTractor("John Deere", "8R", 2024)
tractor.start_engine()
success = tractor.send_tractor_status()  # Works as before
```

**Enhanced Reliable Operation**:
```python
# New guaranteed delivery option
tractor = FarmTractor("John Deere", "8R", 2024)
tractor.start_engine()

# Status with delivery confirmation
success = tractor.send_tractor_status(use_reliable=True)

# With delivery callback
def status_callback(msg_id, status):
    print(f"Status message {msg_id}: {status}")

msg_id = tractor.send_tractor_status_reliable(
    delivery_callback=status_callback,
    requires_ack=True
)
```

### 2. Implement Control with Guaranteed Delivery

```python
# Agricultural implement command with delivery confirmation
def cultivator_callback(msg_id, status):
    if status == "delivered":
        print("Cultivator command confirmed")
    elif status == "failed":
        print("Cultivator command failed - check implement")

msg_id = tractor.send_implement_command(
    implement_address=0x82,
    command_type="lower",
    parameters={"depth": 6.0, "speed": 8.0},
    use_reliable=True,
    delivery_callback=cultivator_callback
)
```

### 3. Multi-Implement Field Coordination

```python
# Coordinate planting operation across multiple implements
field_crdt = FieldAllocationCRDT("corn_field_2024", ["tractor_8r"])
field_crdt.claim("section_north", "tractor_8r")

planters = [0x82, 0x83]  # Two precision planters
message_ids = tractor.coordinate_field_operation(
    field_crdt=field_crdt,
    operation_type="planting",
    implement_addresses=planters,
    use_reliable=True
)

print(f"Tracking {len(message_ids)} coordination messages")
```

### 4. Emergency Stop with Safety Broadcasting

```python
# Safety-critical emergency stop with guaranteed delivery
def emergency_callback(msg_id, status):
    if status == "delivered":
        print(f"Emergency stop confirmed by recipient")
    else:
        print(f"Emergency stop delivery issue: {status}")

message_ids = tractor.emergency_stop_reliable(
    delivery_callback=emergency_callback
)

# Broadcasts to multiple recipients for safety redundancy
print(f"Emergency stop broadcast to {len(message_ids)} recipients")
```

)

# Use guaranteed delivery for all critical operations
emergency_callback = lambda mid, status: log_safety_event(mid, status)
implement_callback = lambda mid, status: log_implement_status(mid, status)
```

**Monitoring and Diagnostics**:
```python
# Monitor message delivery statistics
stats = tractor.reliable_isobus.delivery_tracker.get_stats()
print(f"Pending messages: {stats['pending_messages']}")
