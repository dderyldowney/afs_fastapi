# Data Integrity and Consistency Validation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for validating data integrity and consistency between AFS FastAPI's local systems and integrated agricultural cloud platforms. Ensuring data accuracy and reliability is critical for effective agricultural operations and decision-making.

## Validation Objectives

*   Verify that data transmitted from local systems to the cloud arrives without corruption or loss.
*   Confirm that data received from the cloud by local systems is accurate and consistent with the source.
*   Ensure that data transformations (e.g., format conversions) maintain data integrity.
*   Validate that data synchronization mechanisms correctly handle updates, deletions, and potential conflicts.

## Validation Scenarios

1.  **Telemetry Data Integrity**:
    *   **Scenario**: Send a known set of telemetry data points from a simulated robot to the cloud.
    *   **Validation**: Compare the data received and stored in the cloud (e.g., S3, DynamoDB) against the original sent data. Check for completeness, accuracy, and correct timestamps.

2.  **Command Data Consistency**:
    *   **Scenario**: Issue a command from the cloud to a simulated robot.
    *   **Validation**: Verify that the command is received correctly by the robot and that any resulting status updates are accurately reflected back in the cloud.

3.  **Field Boundary Synchronization Accuracy**:
    *   **Scenario**: Modify a field boundary in AFS FastAPI and observe its synchronization to the cloud. Then, modify the same boundary in the cloud and observe synchronization back to AFS FastAPI.
    *   **Validation**: Compare the geospatial data (e.g., GeoJSON) at each stage to ensure exact matches. Test edge cases like complex polygons or rapid successive updates.

4.  **Data Transformation Validation**:
    *   **Scenario**: Transmit data that requires format conversion (e.g., internal AFS FastAPI format to cloud-specific JSON).
    *   **Validation**: Inspect the transformed data in the cloud to ensure all fields are correctly mapped and values are preserved.

5.  **Error Handling and Data Recovery**:
    *   **Scenario**: Simulate data transmission errors or partial updates.
    *   **Validation**: Verify that the system correctly identifies errors, attempts retries, and either recovers data or logs failures appropriately without corrupting existing data.

## Validation Tools and Techniques

*   **Automated Test Scripts**: Python scripts using `pytest` to automate data comparison and validation.
*   **Checksums/Hashes**: Use data hashing to verify integrity of larger data blocks.
*   **Database Queries**: Direct queries to cloud databases (e.g., DynamoDB) and local databases to compare records.
*   **Logging and Monitoring**: Analyze logs for data discrepancies or errors during transmission.

## Reporting

*   Validation results will be documented, highlighting any inconsistencies or integrity issues.
*   Metrics on data loss, corruption rates, and synchronization latency will be reported.
