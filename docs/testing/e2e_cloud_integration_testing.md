# End-to-End Testing Plan for Cloud Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the end-to-end testing plan for the AFS FastAPI cloud integration module. The goal is to validate the complete data flow, functionality, and performance of the integration within a simulated agricultural environment.

## Testing Environment

*   **Simulated Agricultural Environment**: A virtualized or containerized environment mimicking a farm setup, including:
    *   Simulated robotic systems generating telemetry data.
    *   Simulated field boundaries and operational data.
    *   Network conditions simulating real-world agricultural connectivity (e.g., intermittent connectivity, latency).
*   **Cloud Platform Test Accounts**: Dedicated test accounts for AWS IoT, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.

## Test Scenarios

1.  **Telemetry Ingestion Validation**:
    *   **Objective**: Verify that telemetry data from simulated robots is correctly ingested, processed, and stored in the cloud.
    *   **Steps**:
        *   Start simulated robots generating various telemetry data (GPS, sensor readings, equipment status).
        *   Monitor AWS IoT Core for incoming messages.
        *   Verify data processing by Lambda functions.
        *   Check data persistence in S3 (raw logs) and DynamoDB (structured data).
        *   Validate data integrity and format.

2.  **Command & Control Functionality**:
    *   **Objective**: Verify that commands issued from the cloud are correctly received and processed by simulated robots.
    *   **Steps**:
        *   Issue commands (e.g., `MOVE`, `STOP`, `SPRAY`) from the cloud platform.
        *   Monitor simulated robots for command reception and execution.
        *   Verify that robot status updates are sent back to the cloud.

3.  **Data Synchronization Validation**:
    *   **Objective**: Verify two-way synchronization of critical agricultural data (e.g., field boundaries) between AFS FastAPI and the cloud.
    *   **Steps**:
        *   Modify field boundaries in AFS FastAPI and verify propagation to the cloud.
        *   Modify field boundaries in the cloud and verify synchronization back to AFS FastAPI.
        *   Test conflict resolution scenarios (e.g., simultaneous modifications).

4.  **Error Handling and Resilience**:
    *   **Objective**: Evaluate the system's ability to handle errors, transient failures, and network disruptions.
    *   **Steps**:
        *   Simulate network outages during data transmission.
        *   Test retry mechanisms for telemetry and command delivery.
        *   Introduce invalid data payloads to test error handling.

5.  **Performance and Scalability**:
    *   **Objective**: Assess the system's performance under load and its ability to scale.
    *   **Steps**:
        *   Simulate a large number of concurrent robotic systems sending telemetry.
        *   Measure data ingestion rates and latency.
        *   Evaluate cloud resource utilization and auto-scaling behavior.

## Test Tools

*   **Pytest**: For unit and integration tests.
*   **Mocking Libraries**: `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for simulating external services.
*   **Cloud Provider CLIs/SDKs**: For direct interaction with cloud services during testing.
*   **Custom Simulators**: For generating realistic agricultural data and robot behavior.

## Reporting

*   Test results will be documented, including pass/fail rates, identified bugs, and performance metrics.
