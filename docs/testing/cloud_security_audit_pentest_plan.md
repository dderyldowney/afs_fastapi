# Security Audit and Penetration Testing Plan for Cloud Communication

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for conducting security audits and penetration testing on the AFS FastAPI cloud communication module. The objective is to identify vulnerabilities, assess security posture, and ensure compliance with security best practices for agricultural data.

## Scope of Testing

*   **Cloud Integration Module**: `afs_fastapi/services/cloud_integration.py` and related components.
*   **Cloud Platform Configuration**: Security settings of AWS IoT, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.
*   **Communication Channels**: HTTPS and MQTT protocols used for data exchange.
*   **Authentication and Authorization**: Mechanisms for accessing cloud resources.

## Security Audit Activities

1.  **Code Review**: Manual and automated review of the `cloud_integration.py` module for common security flaws (e.g., injection vulnerabilities, insecure deserialization, improper error handling).
2.  **Configuration Review**: Examination of cloud platform configurations (IAM policies, security groups, network ACLs) to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege and secure defaults.
3.  **Dependency Scanning**: Use of tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
4.  **Compliance Check**: Verify adherence to relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, agricultural data privacy laws).

## Penetration Testing Activities

1.  **Authentication Bypass**: Attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms for cloud APIs and IoT endpoints.
2.  **Authorization Flaws**: Test for privilege escalation or unauthorized access to data/resources by exploiting misconfigurations in RBAC/PBAC policies.
3.  **Data Tampering**: Attempt to modify data in transit or at rest within the cloud platform.
4.  **Denial of Service (DoS) Simulation**: Evaluate the resilience of the cloud integration against DoS attacks (within controlled environments).
5.  **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Test for unauthorized access to specific data records (e.g., another farm's data).
6.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: If web interfaces are part of the integration, test for these vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Techniques

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Tools like Bandit, Pylint.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
*   **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center) for continuous monitoring.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing**: Expert-led testing to uncover complex vulnerabilities.

## Reporting and Remediation

*   All identified vulnerabilities will be documented with severity levels, impact, and recommended remediation steps.
*   A remediation plan will be developed and tracked to ensure all critical and high-severity findings are addressed promptly.
