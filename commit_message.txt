feat(todos): add PostgreSQL support to the module

This integrates SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction and defines schema
migrations using Alembic. It also implements CRUD operations for the ToDoWrite
data.

- Installed `SQLAlchemy`, `psycopg2-binary`, and `alembic`.
- Created a new `afs_fastapi/todos/db` directory to hold the database-related files.
- Created a `config.py` file for database connection configuration.
- Created a `models.py` file to define the SQLAlchemy models.
- Created a `repository.py` file to implement the repository pattern.
- Set up Alembic for schema migrations.
- Updated the `manager.py` script to use the new repository.
- Updated the `savesession` and `loadsession` scripts to use the repository.
- Updated the tests to use the new repository and a test database.
- Added data validation to the CRUD operations.
- Documented the module API.
