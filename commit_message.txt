chore: Synchronize project state and remove temporary files

This commit synchronizes the project's current working state by staging all modified and untracked files, and removing deleted files from the repository.

Key changes include:
- Updates to various core, database, equipment, and bin scripts.
- Removal of several temporary and unused Python scripts (e.g., `fix_todos_duplicates.py`, `generate_summary.py`, `temp_*.py`, `tractor_demo.py`).
- Addition of new type-related files (`afs_fastapi/monitoring/py.typed`, `afs_fastapi/py.typed`, `models/__init__.py`, `monitoring/sensor_data_schema.pyi`) and a new `models/__init__.py`.
- Updates to `.claude/current_session.json` and `mypy.ini`.
- Modifications to various test files to reflect current project structure and dependencies.

This commit aims to bring the repository up-to-date with recent development activities and clean up residual temporary files.
