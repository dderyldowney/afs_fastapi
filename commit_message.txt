docs(agents): Enforce type hinting and annotation for all agents

This commit updates the agent configuration files to enforce the use of
type hints and annotations for all code and tests generated by AI agents.
This is a critical requirement to ensure code quality, reliability, and
maintainability of the agricultural robotics platform.

The following changes are included:

- **AGENTS.md:** Added a new "Mandatory Type Hinting and Annotation"
  section with the rationale and enforcement mechanism.
- **GEMINI.md:** Added a new memory to enforce the type hinting and
  annotation rule.
- **CLAUDE.md:** Added a new section to enforce the type hinting and
  annotation rule.
