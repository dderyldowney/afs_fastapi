feat(todos): make ToDo system standalone with a local database

This makes the ToDo system standalone by implementing a local database
solution using SQLite. This encapsulates all necessary configurations and
data within a dedicated directory structure.

- A new `database.py` script has been created to manage the database.
- The `manager.py` script has been updated to read from the database instead
  of the YAML files.
- A migration script has been created to migrate the data from the YAML
  files to the database.
- The tests have been updated to use the new database solution.
- The documentation has been updated to reflect the new database solution.
- The `plans` directory and the migration script have been removed.
