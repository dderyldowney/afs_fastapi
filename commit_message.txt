refactor(todos): move ToDo system to a new module

This moves the entire ToDo system to a new `todos` module to better
encapsulate its functionality and align with the new 12-layer ToDoWrite
system.

- The `todos_manager.py` script has been moved to `afs_fastapi/todos/manager.py`
  and refactored to work with the new 12-layer ToDoWrite system.
- The `plans` directory has been moved to `afs_fastapi/todos/plans`.
- The `.claude/todos.json` file has been moved to `afs_fastapi/todos/todos.json`.
- All import paths have been updated to point to the new module.
- New tests have been created for the `todos` module.
- The `savesession` and `loadsession` scripts have been updated to use the
  new `todos` module.
- Type consistency has been ensured by running `mypy`.
- The module API has been documented with docstrings.
