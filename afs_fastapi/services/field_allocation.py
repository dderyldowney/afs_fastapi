"""CRDT Placeholder for Field Section Allocation.

This module defines a minimal placeholder for a Conflict-Free Replicated Data
Type (CRDT) to coordinate field section allocation across multiple tractors
operating under intermittent connectivity.

Agricultural Context
--------------------
- Multiple tractors (heterogeneous fleet) claim/release sections in a field.
- Must converge without central coordination and tolerate network partitions.
- Safety-critical operations require deterministic, auditable resolution rules.

Notes
-----
- This is a scaffolding placeholder to guide TDD development.
- All methods raise NotImplementedError by design; tests are currently xfail
  scaffolds describing intended behavior and API.

    Intended API for an eventually consistent, conflict-free replica that assigns
    field sections (cells) to equipment owners (tractors) with deterministic
    conflict resolution and efficient serialization for ISOBUS constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field_id : str
        Unique identifier for the field (e.g., "field_001").

    Notes
    -----
    - Target properties: convergence, commutativity, associativity, idempotence.
    - Deterministic merge policy proposed in the spec using vector-clock first,
      then LWW timestamp, then lexicographic owner_id.
    - See tests in ``tests/unit/services/test_field_allocation_crdt.py``.
