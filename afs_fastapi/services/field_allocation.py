"""CRDT Implementation for Field Section Allocation.

This module implements a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) using
Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) semantics with vector clock causality to coordinate
field section allocation across multiple tractors under intermittent connectivity.

Agricultural Context
--------------------
- Multiple tractors (heterogeneous fleet) claim/release sections in a field.
- Must converge without central coordination and tolerate network partitions.
- Safety-critical operations require deterministic, auditable resolution rules.
- Implements ISO 11783 compatible serialization for ISOBUS messaging.

CRDT Design
-----------
- Type: LWW-Register with vector clock causality
- Conflict Resolution: Vector clock → LWW timestamp → lexicographic owner_id
- Data Structure: Each section stores (owner_id, vector_clock, lww_timestamp)
- Properties: Convergence, commutativity, associativity, idempotence

    """Field allocation CRDT with LWW-Register and vector clock causality.

    Implements an eventually consistent, conflict-free replica that assigns
    field sections (cells) to equipment owners (tractors) with deterministic
    conflict resolution and efficient serialization for ISOBUS constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field_id : str
        Unique identifier for the field (e.g., "field_001").
    tractor_ids : list[str], optional
        Initial list of tractor IDs for vector clock initialization.
        If not provided, tractors are added dynamically as they appear.

    Notes
    -----
    - CRDT properties: convergence, commutativity, associativity, idempotence.
    - Conflict resolution: vector clock → LWW timestamp → lexicographic owner_id.
    - Each section stores: (owner_id, vector_clock, lww_timestamp).
    - See tests in ``tests/unit/services/test_field_allocation_crdt.py``.
