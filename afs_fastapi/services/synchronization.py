"""Distributed Systems Synchronization Components for Agricultural Robotics.

This module implements vector clocks and related distributed systems primitives
for coordinating multi-tractor operations in agricultural environments.

Vector clocks provide causal ordering of events across distributed tractors
without requiring centralized coordination, essential for field operations
with intermittent network connectivity.

Agricultural Context:
- Multiple tractors operating simultaneously in the same field
- Network connectivity may be intermittent in rural areas
- Operations must be correctly sequenced for safety and efficiency
- ISOBUS protocol constraints require efficient timestamp encoding

    """Vector Clock implementation for distributed tractor coordination.

    A vector clock is a logical clock that provides causal ordering of events
    in a distributed system. Each process (tractor) maintains a vector of
    logical timestamps, one for each process in the system.

    Agricultural Use Case:
    When multiple tractors work the same field, vector clocks ensure that
    operations like "tractor A finished section 1" â†’ "tractor B started section 2"
    are properly ordered even if messages arrive out of order due to network delays.

    Attributes:
        _clocks: Dictionary mapping process IDs to logical timestamps
        _process_ids: Set of all known process IDs in the system
