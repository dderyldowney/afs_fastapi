"""Emergency Stop Propagation System for Agricultural Fleet Coordination.

This module implements fleet-wide emergency stop coordination using vector clock
causal ordering and guaranteed message delivery for autonomous agricultural
equipment safety. Ensures sub-500ms emergency propagation across multi-tractor
operations with ISO 18497 safety compliance.

The EmergencyStopPropagation system provides the highest priority safety
coordination for agricultural robotics, ensuring that when any tractor detects
a safety hazard, all fleet members immediately stop operations to prevent
accidents, equipment damage, and ensure operator safety.

Agricultural Context
--------------------
Emergency stop propagation is critical for:
- Multi-tractor field operations with coordinated cultivation, planting, harvesting
- Obstacle detection and collision avoidance across autonomous equipment
- Operator safety interventions requiring immediate fleet response
- Equipment malfunction isolation preventing cascade failures
- ISO 18497 Performance Level D (PLd) safety compliance for commercial deployment

Implementation follows TDD GREEN phase - minimal implementation
satisfying comprehensive test requirements for safety-critical operations.
