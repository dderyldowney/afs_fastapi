# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Mandatory TDD Enforcement Active

## Claude Code Generation TDD Compliance

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Claude Code MUST follow Test-Driven Development methodology for ALL code generation in this AFS FastAPI agricultural robotics platform.

### TDD Protocol Enforcement
- **RED Phase FIRST**: Write failing tests before any code generation
- **GREEN Phase**: Generate minimal code to satisfy agricultural requirements
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Enhance quality while maintaining test coverage

### Automated Validation Active
- Pre-commit hooks validate TDD compliance (`.claude/hooks/tdd_enforcement.py`)
- Safety standards validation for ISO 18497 compliance
- Agricultural context required in all generated tests
- Performance validation for embedded equipment constraints

### Session Continuity
This requirement persists across ALL future Claude Code sessions and must be applied immediately upon session start.

**RATIONALE**: Agricultural robotics requires bulletproof reliability. AI-generated code must meet the same rigorous standards as human-developed components for safety-critical multi-tractor coordination systems.

**Status**: ACTIVE and ENFORCED
**Scope**: ALL Claude Code generation
**Validation**: Automated pre-commit hooks
