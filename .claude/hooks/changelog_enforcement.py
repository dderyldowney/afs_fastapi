MANDATORY CHANGELOG.md Enforcement Hook for AFS FastAPI

This hook ensures CHANGELOG.md is included in every git commit for the
agricultural robotics platform, maintaining complete version history essential
for ISO 18497/11783 compliance auditing.

ENFORCEMENT:
- All commits must include CHANGELOG.md in staged files
- Exception: Merge commits (already documented in individual commits)
- Rationale: Equipment operators, safety engineers, and compliance auditors
  depend on CHANGELOG.md as authoritative record of platform modifications

Agricultural Context:
- Safety-critical multi-tractor coordination systems require complete change tracking
- ISO 18497 (agricultural machinery safety) audits require documented modifications
- ISO 11783 (ISOBUS) compliance depends on version history documentation
- Emergency incident investigation relies on complete change history

❌ CHANGELOG.md Enforcement Violation:
{self.changelog_filename} is not included in staged files for this commit.

📋 MANDATORY REQUIREMENT:
ALL commits to the agricultural robotics platform MUST include {self.changelog_filename}
updates to maintain complete version history essential for ISO 18497/11783
compliance auditing.

🔧 How to Fix:
1. Update {self.changelog_filename} with your changes in the [Unreleased] section
2. Stage the updated file: git add {self.changelog_filename}
3. Complete your commit: git commit

🌾 Agricultural Context:
Equipment operators, safety engineers, and compliance auditors depend on
{self.changelog_filename} as the authoritative record of all platform modifications
affecting multi-tractor coordination systems. Complete change tracking is essential
for safety-critical agricultural robotics operations.
