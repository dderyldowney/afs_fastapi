# Dual TODO System: Strategic + Phase Management

**AFS FastAPI Agricultural Robotics Platform**
**System Version**: 1.0.0
**Integration**: Universal across all AI agents and human sessions

---

## Overview

The Dual TODO System provides two-level task management for complex agricultural robotics development, ensuring both strategic development momentum and tactical implementation tracking across multi-session work cycles.

### Architecture

**STRATEGIC TODOs**: Big-picture development momentum
- **Purpose**: Maintain overall platform advancement direction across sessions
- **Scope**: Major phases, feature categories, integration milestones
- **Persistence**: Long-term (weeks/months of development)
- **Examples**: "Phase 7 enhancement", "Cloud integration", "IoT sensor networks"

**PHASE TODOs**: Current work detailed steps
- **Purpose**: Track specific implementation steps for active development
- **Scope**: TDD methodology steps, technical tasks, validation activities
- **Persistence**: Short-term (single phase/sprint completion)
- **Examples**: "RED phase: Write failing tests", "REFACTOR: Optimize performance"

## Command Interface

### Strategic TODO Management

**Add Strategic TODO**:
```bash
./bin/strategic-add "Implement advanced fleet coordination capabilities"
```

**List Strategic TODOs**:
```bash
./bin/strategic-list
```

**Complete Strategic TODO**:
```bash
./bin/strategic-complete "Phase 6 ISOBUS guaranteed delivery"
```

**Strategic Status Overview**:
```bash
./bin/strategic-status
```

### Phase TODO Management

**Start New Phase**:
```bash
./bin/phase-start "Phase 7: Advanced Fleet Coordination"
```

**Add Phase Step**:
```bash
./bin/phase-add "Investigate current fleet coordination patterns"
```

**Complete Phase Step**:
```bash
./bin/phase-complete "RED phase: Write failing tests for fleet coordination"
```

**Phase Progress Status**:
```bash
./bin/phase-status
```

**End Current Phase**:
```bash
./bin/phase-end
```

### Integrated Management

**Full TODO Status** (Strategic + Phase):
```bash
./bin/todo-status
```

**Session Handoff Preparation**:
```bash
./bin/todo-handoff
```

**Load Context from TODOs**:
```bash
./bin/todo-restore
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Between Sessions
1. **Strategic TODOs** maintain development momentum
2. **Phase TODOs** show current work status
3. **Handoff commands** prepare context for next session
4. **Restore commands** reload development state

### Starting New Phase
1. Choose from Strategic TODO list
2. Create Phase TODO with `./bin/phase-start`
3. Populate Phase steps following TDD methodology:
   - Investigation
   - Design
   - RED phase (failing tests)
   - GREEN phase (minimal implementation)
   - REFACTOR phase (quality enhancement)
   - Integration
   - Validation
   - Documentation

### During Active Development
1. Update Phase TODOs as work progresses
2. Strategic TODOs provide context and direction
3. Use status commands for progress visibility
4. Complete phase steps systematically

### Completing Phase
1. Mark final Phase TODO complete
2. Mark corresponding Strategic TODO complete
3. Archive phase work with `./bin/phase-end`
4. Strategic TODOs guide next development priority

## Integration with AFS FastAPI Platform

### Session Management Integration
- **loadsession**: Automatically includes TODO context
- **savesession**: Preserves both Strategic and Phase states
- **whereweare**: Incorporates TODO status in strategic assessment

### Agricultural Context Integration
- **Strategic TODOs**: Align with agricultural robotics development priorities
- **Phase TODOs**: Follow TDD methodology for safety-critical agricultural systems
- **Compliance Tracking**: Support ISO 11783/18497 development requirements

### Cross-Agent Consistency
- **Universal System**: All AI agents use identical TODO management
- **State Synchronization**: TODO state shared across agent sessions
- **Progress Continuity**: Development momentum maintained regardless of agent

## Standard Development Methodology

### TDD Phase Pattern (Template)
When starting agricultural robotics enhancement:

**Investigation Phase**:
```
PHASE: Investigate [component] implementation and requirements
PHASE: Analyze existing [system] integration points
PHASE: Document [feature] design requirements
```

**Implementation Phase**:
```
PHASE: RED phase - Write failing tests for [feature]
PHASE: GREEN phase - Implement minimal [feature] functionality
PHASE: REFACTOR phase - Enhance [feature] quality and performance
```

**Integration Phase**:
```
PHASE: Integrate [feature] with existing agricultural systems
PHASE: Validate [feature] with comprehensive test suite
PHASE: Document [feature] completion with safety compliance notes
```

### Agricultural Safety Integration
All phase work must consider:
- **ISO 11783 Compliance**: ISOBUS standards for agricultural communication
- **ISO 18497 Safety**: Agricultural machinery safety requirements
- **Test-First Development**: Safety-critical systems require comprehensive testing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing agricultural workflows
