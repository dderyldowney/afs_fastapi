## Universal AI Agent Requirements

### Cross-Agent Accessibility

**ALL AI agents MUST**:
- Execute this command immediately after `/new` session initialization
- Understand platform state completely before any development work
- Recognize mandatory requirements (TDD, investigation pattern, test reporting, etc.)
- Apply agricultural context to all development decisions

**Applies To**:
- Claude Code (primary development assistant) **[ACTIVE]**
- GitHub Copilot (code completion and suggestions) **[ACTIVE]**
- ChatGPT (conversational AI assistant) **[COMPATIBLE - INACTIVE]**
- Gemini Code Assist (Google AI development assistant) **[COMPATIBLE - INACTIVE]**
- Amazon CodeWhisperer (AWS AI coding companion) **[COMPATIBLE - INACTIVE]**
- ALL future AI development assistants

### Session Initialization Integration

**Automatic Discovery**:
1. **SessionStart hook**: [.claude/hooks/session_initialization.py](.claude/hooks/session_initialization.py) detects new sessions via 5-minute staleness detection
2. **Manual execution**: `bin/loadsession` provides fallback context restoration
3. **AGENTS.md** instructs all AI platforms about command availability
4. **CLAUDE.md** provides complete command specifications
5. **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** serves as authoritative source of truth (304 lines)

**Persistent Memory**:
- Command MUST be executed after `/new` session restarts
- Universal access ensures all AI agents can restore context
- Cross-session persistence through SESSION_SUMMARY.md

- 5-minute staleness detection prevents false positives
- Fallback: Manual execution if automatic trigger fails

**Manual Verification**:
```bash
# Verify loadsession executable
./bin/loadsession

# Check SESSION_SUMMARY.md exists
cat docs/monitoring/SESSION_SUMMARY.md | head -20

# Validate session state
./bin/whereweare  # Strategic assessment
```

### Test Validation

**Pre-Commit Hooks** ensure loadsession infrastructure remains operational:
- Session initialization hook tests (10 tests)
- SESSION_SUMMARY.md format validation
- Mandatory requirements documentation checks

**Manual Testing**:
```bash
# Test loadsession execution
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/unit/hooks/test_session_initialization.py -v

# Verify automatic session detection
# (requires actual session restart simulation)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "SESSION_SUMMARY.md not found"

**Cause**: Missing or moved SESSION_SUMMARY.md file
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify location
ls -la docs/monitoring/SESSION_SUMMARY.md

# If missing, check git history
git log --all --full-history -- docs/monitoring/SESSION_SUMMARY.md
```

### "Automatic loadsession didn't trigger"

**Cause**: Rapid `/new` restart within 5-minute staleness window
**Solution**: Execute manually
```bash
./bin/loadsession
```

### "Permission denied"

**Cause**: Script not executable
**Solution**:
```bash
chmod +x bin/loadsession
```

### "Context not fully understood after loadsession"

**Cause**: AI agent didn't properly parse SESSION_SUMMARY.md
**Solution**:
1. Verify SESSION_SUMMARY.md format is correct
2. Manually read and explain key sections to AI agent
3. Check AI agent logs for parsing errors
