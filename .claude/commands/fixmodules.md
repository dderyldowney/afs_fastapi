# Fix Module Import Errors Command

## Command Name
fixmodules

## Purpose
Resolves common `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'afs_fastapi'` issues that occur after commits or package modifications.

## Description
This command reinstalls the AFS FastAPI package in development mode, ensuring all module imports work correctly for the agricultural robotics platform.

## Implementation
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## When to Use
- After git commits that modify package structure
- When tests fail with module import errors
- Before running test suites to ensure clean environment
- When switching between development sessions

## Expected Output
```
Obtaining file:///Users/.../afs_fastapi
...
Successfully installed afs_fastapi-0.1.3
```

## Validation
Run this command to verify the fix worked:
```bash
python -c "import afs_fastapi; print('Module import successful')"
```

## Agricultural Context
Module import failures can prevent execution of safety-critical agricultural robotics tests, potentially masking equipment coordination issues. This command ensures the development environment remains stable for reliable multi-tractor system validation.

## Integration with Workflow
- Use before running `pytest` commands
- Execute after package structure changes
- Include in development session initialization
- Part of error recovery procedures
