# loadsession Command

## Purpose

Loads and applies the SESSION_SUMMARY.md to restore complete project context and continue from the previous session state. This command must be executed immediately after `/new` completes for all AFS FastAPI project sessions.

## Command Sequence

```
Load and apply SESSION_SUMMARY.md
```

## Expected Output

The command will:

1. **Read SESSION_SUMMARY.md**: Load the comprehensive session history and project state documentation
2. **Context Integration**: Apply all previous session achievements, strategic decisions, and current platform capabilities
3. **Platform State Restoration**: Understand current v0.1.3 release status, testing framework, and development methodology
4. **Strategic Direction**: Resume development from established synchronization infrastructure priorities

## Usage Context

### When to Execute

- **Mandatory**: First command after `/new` in all AFS FastAPI project sessions
- **Session Initialization**: Before any development, analysis, or documentation work
- **Context Restoration**: When returning to the project after any break in development

### Prerequisites

- SESSION_SUMMARY.md must exist in project root
- Claude Code session must be initialized in the AFS FastAPI project directory
- No other commands should be executed before loadsession

## Expected Response Structure

The command response should include:

1. **Platform State Summary**: Current enterprise foundation status (v0.1.3, 129 tests, zero warnings)
2. **Strategic Context**: Understanding of Test-First Development methodology and synchronization infrastructure focus
3. **Development Readiness**: Confirmation of distributed systems foundation and next development priorities
4. **Session Continuity**: Clear indication that all previous session achievements are understood and integrated

## Technical Specifications

### Input Format
```
loadsession
```

### Output Requirements

- **Comprehensive Context**: Full integration of all previous session achievements
- **Strategic Alignment**: Understanding of platform evolution and current priorities
- **Development Readiness**: Prepared to continue sophisticated agricultural robotics development
- **Educational Framework**: Dual-purpose instructional and functional mission preserved

## Integration with Project Workflow

### Session Initialization Sequence

1. Execute `/new` to start Claude Code session
2. **Execute `loadsession`** (this command)
3. Proceed with session-specific development objectives

### Quality Assurance

- Ensures consistent session initialization across all team members
- Maintains project context continuity across development cycles
- Preserves strategic direction and enterprise-grade standards
- Supports educational framework objectives

## Command Rationale

**Session Context Preservation**: The AFS FastAPI platform has evolved through multiple sophisticated development cycles with comprehensive documentation, testing excellence, and strategic frameworks. The loadsession command ensures that every new session begins with complete understanding of this enterprise-grade foundation, enabling confident continuation of advanced agricultural robotics development.

## Version Control

This command specification is version-controlled as part of the .claude/commands/ framework, ensuring consistent team-wide session initialization and maintaining the project's professional development standards.
