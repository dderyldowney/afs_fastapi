## 🚨 CRITICAL: Mandatory TDD Enforcement for Claude Code Generation

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Claude Code sessions MUST follow Test-Driven Development methodology:

### TDD Protocol for All Future Sessions
1. **RED Phase Required**: Write failing tests BEFORE generating any code
2. **GREEN Phase Implementation**: Generate minimal code to satisfy test requirements
3. **REFACTOR Phase Enhancement**: Improve code quality while maintaining coverage

### Enforcement Mechanisms Active
- **Pre-commit hooks validate TDD compliance** - `.claude/hooks/tdd_enforcement.py`
- **Safety standards validation** - `.claude/hooks/safety_validation.py`
- **Automated quality gates prevent non-TDD code** from entering codebase
- **Agricultural context mandatory** in all generated tests

**RATIONALE**: Agricultural robotics demands bulletproof reliability. AI-generated code must meet the same rigorous standards as human-developed components for safety-critical multi-tractor coordination.
