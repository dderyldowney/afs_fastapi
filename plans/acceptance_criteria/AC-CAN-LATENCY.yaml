title: CAN message transmission meets timing requirements
description: |
  Given multiple tractors operating in field coordination mode,
  when position data is transmitted via CAN bus,
  then message frequency shall be minimum 10Hz with end-to-end latency under 50ms
  measured over 95th percentile during 30-minute field operation.
