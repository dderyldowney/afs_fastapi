"""
Scaffold tests for CRDT-based field allocation (synchronization spec).

Agricultural Context:
- Multiple tractors share a field with intermittent connectivity.
- We need conflict-free, convergent section allocation without central control.
- This file defines RED-phase expectations as xfail scaffolds pending implementation.

Notes
-----
- These tests are marked xfail to document intended behavior while keeping the suite green.
- Issue reference: #6 (CRDT-based field allocation design & implementation).
