"""
Test-First Development Example: Vector Clock for Multi-Tractor Synchronization

This module demonstrates the Red-Green-Refactor methodology applied to
distributed systems components in agricultural robotics. Vector clocks
provide the foundation for ordering events across multiple tractors
operating in the same field without requiring centralized coordination.

Agricultural Context:
- Multiple tractors must coordinate field operations (planting, harvesting)
- Network connectivity may be intermittent in rural areas
- Operations must be sequenced correctly even with communication delays
- Safety requires precise ordering of equipment movements
