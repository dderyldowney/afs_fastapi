"""Tests for CommunicationLossFailSafe - TDD RED Phase Implementation.

This module implements comprehensive unit tests for the CommunicationLossFailSafe
system, which ensures safe autonomous agricultural operations during network
partitions and communication failures between fleet coordination systems.

Agricultural Context
--------------------
Agricultural tractors often operate in rural areas with poor connectivity.
When network communication is lost between tractors, the system must:
- Detect communication health status accurately
- Implement safe fail-safe behaviors for different loss scenarios
- Maintain operational capability where safe to do so
- Restore coordination safely when connectivity returns

The system implements ISO 18497 fail-safe requirements for autonomous
agricultural equipment, ensuring no unsafe conditions during communication loss.

Test Strategy
-------------
Tests follow TDD methodology with realistic agricultural scenarios:
1. RED Phase: Failing tests defining expected fail-safe behavior
2. GREEN Phase: Minimal implementation meeting safety requirements
3. REFACTOR Phase: Enhanced implementation with reliability improvements

These tests validate actual fail-safe logic, not mock behavior.
