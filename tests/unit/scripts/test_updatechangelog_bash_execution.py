"""Tests for updatechangelog bash script execution enhancements.

This test suite validates the bash script's ability to detect Python executables,
handle dependency isolation, and execute robustly across different environments.

Agricultural Context:
Safety-critical agricultural robotics requires robust CHANGELOG.md generation
that works in development sessions, CI/CD pipelines, and manual command-line
usage without dependency failures that could interrupt safety audit documentation.

RED Phase Tests:
These tests will fail until the corresponding bash script functionality
is implemented following Test-Driven Development methodology.
