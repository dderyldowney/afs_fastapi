"""Integration Tests for Fleet Coordination - Actual Multi-Tractor Functionality Validation.

These integration tests validate actual agricultural robotics fleet coordination
functionality using real component instances, not mocks. Tests ensure genuine
multi-tractor coordination, emergency propagation, and field allocation work
correctly for commercial agricultural deployment.

Agricultural Context
--------------------
Integration tests simulate realistic field operations with multiple autonomous
tractors working the same field. Tests validate:
- Actual conflict-free field section allocation using FieldAllocationCRDT
- Genuine emergency stop propagation across tractor fleet using vector clocks
- Real fleet coordination state synchronization during network partitions
- Authentic collision avoidance and safety zone management
- True ISO 18497 safety compliance for autonomous agricultural equipment

Test Philosophy
---------------
These tests validate ACTUAL functionality, not mock behavior:
- Real FleetCoordinationEngine instances coordinating multiple tractors
- Actual EmergencyStopPropagation systems with genuine message passing
- True CRDT conflict resolution with deterministic merge behavior
- Authentic vector clock causal ordering across distributed operations
- Genuine agricultural robotics scenarios (planting, harvesting, cultivation)

No mocks are used for core coordination logic - only for external dependencies
like actual ISOBUS hardware interfaces that cannot be simulated in testing.
